# Docker

Docker Compose starts MySQL and the Spring Boot backend with a small demo dataset.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop running.
- Port `8080` available for the backend.
- Port `3307` available for Docker MySQL.

## Start

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Backend:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Swagger:

```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
```

Uploaded photos (student profile photos and photo albums) are stored on a named volume (`preschool_uploads_data`, mounted at `/app/uploads` in the container), so they survive `docker compose down` (but not `docker compose down -v`).

Docker MySQL is exposed on the host as:

```text
localhost:3307
```

Credentials inside Docker:

```text
Database: preschool_admin_db_v2
User: preschool
Password: preschool
Root password: rootpassword
```

Demo API users:

```text
admin@school.com / 123456
director@school.com / 123456
finance@school.com / 123456
parent.demo@school.com / 123456
teacher@school.com / 123456
assistant@school.com / 123456
parent.sofia@school.com / 123456
parent.noah@school.com / 123456
parent.emma@school.com / 123456
```

## Smoke Test

In another terminal:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 node scripts/api-smoke-test.mjs
```

## Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove the MySQL Docker volume and start from a clean database:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
